Task Manager
============

### Instructions

Create a task manager app based on the task_manager.png screenshot using your choice of JS libraries and the given API. This starter project has jQuery, support for ES6, and Jest for testing.

Start server

```
npm install

This will give routes such as `GET http://localhost:3000/categories` and `GET http://localhost:3000/tasks`which respond with JSON. The others can be found in server.js.

Compile client code

npm install
npm run-script watch
```

Note: the client "app" can be run by just opening index.html in a browser

Run client tests
